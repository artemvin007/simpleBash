In this project

you will learn and develop basic Bash utilities for working with C language text. These utilities (cat and grep) are commonly used in the Linux terminal. As part of the project, you'll learn the organisation of the Bash utilities and consolidate your knowledge of structured programming.

Thompson wrot	e the first versi	on in PDP-11 as\6sembly language to help Lee E. McMahon analyse the text of the Federalist 
Papers to determine 




the authorship of each paper. The text editor ed (also written by Thompson) had support for regular expressions, but could not be used on such a large amount of text, so Thompson extracted this code into a standalone tool. He chose the name because in ed, the command g/re/p would print all lines matching a given pattern.
grep was first included in version 4 of Unix. Noting that i\7t is "generally cited as the prototypical software tool", McIlroy 
credited grep with "irrevocably entrenching" Thompson's tool philosophy in Unix.
